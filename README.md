# QSO Map generator

Actually work in progress, is an application to generate data file, html and Javascript, to include a Map of QSO in an HTML page.

You ca see an example in this [page of my web site](https://bobboteck.github.io/sota/sota-monte-elefante/), where now I wrote the data file manually.

The purpose of this application is to facilitate the writing of the data file and to provide a prewiev tool before inserting everything into your website.

## Developing

Application made with React, TypeScript and Bootstrap, as far as the code is concerned.

It uses data from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright), the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library to manage the map and [Stamen's](https://stamen.com/open-source/) open source tiles.

Any suggestions or support are welcome!
